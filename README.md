<h3> About program:  </h3>
<p> The program will download pieces of information about music from your YT playlist and then add them to the Spotify playlist. To avoid a long time
of the process, information about existing files in your YT playlist is saved in a file with a .csv extension. Remember that there are two things to do so the process of automation is not perfect yet.</p>
<p>You have to set your credentials to secrets.py file. To do it, use the following links:</p>
<ul>
    <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th5_9woFJmk - for YouTube credentials</li>
    <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FsFT6OwE1A&t=1948s - for Spotify credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have done that, be sure to install requirements.</p>
<p>To do list:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Changes in the .csv file when you delete music from the YouTube playlist. Now the program doesn't check if the music is still in the YouTube playlist (it does it for Spotify playlist because the process is much quicker).</li>
    <li>If you delete music from the YouTube playlist program should delete this music from the Spotify playlist. This thing is related to the previous thing to do.</li>
</ol>
